ECG notes:

Part number for MCU: STM32F030C8T6

The QFN could use a slightly smaller stencil center pad.

Vpri has been set to 1.18V, resulting in a pre-diode voltage of 4.74V - that can't be right.
Pre-diode voltage should be exactly 6V if possible.

Set the RHS and RLS to different values: RLS to 6.8k and RHS to 6.04k. -> resulting in vpri of 1.56V and pre-diode voltage of 6.26V.
The resulting post-diode voltage is, depending on load, between 6.02V and 5.36V, within the parameters of the LDO regulator.

Reworking board to match. Measuring after, transients look excellent, might be worth doubling up on the bulk caps post diode and after each LDO.
Voltages are spot-on.

Missing reset pin on MCU - bring out to connector.

Current draw on startup - 80mA at 5V- yay!

Issues:

The board doesn't work as designed.
Zeners are conducting - pulling everything to 2.5V - need higher voltage zeners.
Pulling averages off the gain resistors won't work - needs to be on the inputs themselves, possibly buffered.
To get a unipolar negative, we need a wilson terminal between LL, RA and LA -buffering LL won't work.
