ECG notes:

Part number for MCU: STM32F030C8T6

The QFN could use a slightly smaller stencil center pad.

Vpri has been set to 1.18V, resulting in a pre-diode voltage of 4.74V - that can't be right.
Pre-diode voltage should be exactly 6V if possible.

Set the RHS and RLS to different values: RLS to 6.8k and RHS to 6.04k. -> resulting in vpri of 1.56V and pre-diode voltage of 6.26V.
The resulting post-diode voltage is, depending on load, between 6.02V and 5.36V, within the parameters of the LDO regulator.

Reworking board to match. Measuring after, transients look excellent, might be worth doubling up on the bulk caps post diode and after each LDO.
Voltages are spot-on.

Missing reset pin on MCU - bring out to connector.

Current draw on startup - 80mA at 5V- yay!

SHIELD:
PB9 (TIM17_CH1/AF2)

Issues:

The board doesn't work as designed.
Zeners are conducting - pulling everything to 2.5V - need higher voltage zeners.
Pulling averages off the gain resistors won't work - needs to be on the inputs themselves, possibly buffered.
To get a unipolar negative, we need a wilson terminal between LL, RA and LA -buffering LL won't work.

Spencer and I (Kliment) decided to try two approaches:

Spencer will try to build a 5-lead ECG with the current AFE components using a Wilson terminal
I will build a proto based on an integrated AFE setup using the TI ADS1198 IC. This is pin-compatible with the higher-resolution 1298.

For some reason, the ADS1198 evaluation kit has the leads in an odd order:
 V6 on channel 1, LA-RA on channel 2, LL-RA on channel 3, V2-5 on chans 4-7, V1 on chan 8. Looks to be for connector pinout reasons.
 
Will skip that and place LA-RA and LL-RA on chans 1 and 2 and v1-6 on chans 3-8

The negatives of all channels except 1 and 2 are connected to WCT.
The negatives of channels 1 and 2 are connected to each other and to RA.

C1P is connected to LA.
C2P is connected to LL.

Initial schematic and layout, reusing the power supply circuit from the previous revision.

Bringing out nRESET this time, to a jumper

Connector for programming has 5V, 3.3V, GND, SWDIO and SWDCLK

Need to decide what to do with last pin

Maybe put LEDs on top of MCU?

Decision needs to be made on defib protection.
RLD is driven as on figure 50 of datasheet. 
Use same signal (RLD) buffered for shield. Inverted or not?
