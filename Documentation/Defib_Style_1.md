## Defibrillator Protection Circuitry Design Notes##
During medical emergencies patient monitoring software gives vital information that allows for treatment planning and diagnosis. With respect to an *electrocardiogram* (ECG) one such emergency situation that is common is the application of cardiac defibrillator. In this implementation it was decided that ECG leads should have the capability to be left on during the application of a defibrillator pulse to allow for rapid reassessment of heart rhythms following this maneuver.

The electronics that are used to acquire the ECG during normal use however are not intended to handle the high voltage and current that will be produced by the defibrillator. If this circuitry fails there is the potential for many dangers :

- Loss of defibrillator energy into ECG telemetry
- Permanent damage to medical equipment 
- Unwanted conduction paths of defibrillator energy to patient or operator
- Inability to continue monitoring of patient after delivery of shock

In order to avoid these outcomes input protection was created in accordance to the following specifications 

### Defibrillator Pulse Characteristics 
Defibrillator circuits can be modelled as an RLC switching circuit. A 32 microFarad capacitor is initially charged using a 5kV source. Once this capacitor is fully charged it is connected to an inductor (500 microHenries) in series with the patient which is modelled as a resistance between 50-150 ohms. (**see associated image "DefibCircuitModel"**). 

The capacitor is charged to 5000V (equivalent energy of 400J) and discharged through an an inductor before reaching the patient. Some energy is dissipated during this process resulting in a maximum of 360J being passed to the patient with a peak voltage of 5kV and current of 50A. This figures are based on historically values when defibrillation pulses were administered as monophasic pulses. In present day biphasic pulses are used at lower energies and voltages but these monophasic values are still used for validating design, as will be done in this implementation. 

####Design Specifications 
- Protection Circuit does not interfere with standard operation
- When defibrillator pulse is administered, 5% or less of current can be shunted away from patient
-  ECG monitoring hardware must be sufficiently protected and return to monitoring ~5s after delivery of pulse
-  Protection Circuitry should also protect ICs from smaller, electrostatic discharge (~15+V)
-  Ability to withstand 5kV for a no less than 3ms

####Design Methodology
Using these parameters the protection circuit needs to be comprised of two elements :

1. High voltage shunting elements to disperse defibrillator pulses
2. Lower voltage shunting elements to disperse ESD interference

For the first requirement two circuit elements that could work are : **gas discharge tubes / NeAr lamps** or **transient voltage suppressor diodes** the electrical characteristics of each are similar but the foot print of the TVS device is much smaller. This implementation is intended to be created using surface mountable devices and as such **
a TVS will be used with a reversal voltage ~75V.** Before this element there will be a 30 kiloOhm that is capable of withstanding larger energies. Picking this ensure that in the worst case situation only ~3% of the defibrillators current will be shunted away from the patient. (Assume patient impedance of 150 Ohm)

The second circuit will be created using two back-to-back zener diodes with cut off values of ~7V. The instrumentation amplifier can withstand up to 36V at the input which is well above the limit imposed by these elements. An additional current 10 kiloOhm current limiting resistor before these diodes ensure that the zener diodes will not be exposed to dangers currents..
