All OpAmps can be OPA4171, I haven't included power caps for these chips but assumed you had already picked something out

I am unsure how the SMD gas discharge tube (D2) will respond because it may not be able to take the entire voltage for the duration of the defib pulse. I have found documentation elsewhere that shows D1 in this same circuit that works. I would like pads for each on the first iteration of the board so we can try each and see what works.
